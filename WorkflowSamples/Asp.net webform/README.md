This sample demos how to use the API to authenticate, upload and tranlsate model files from an asp.net webform application.

1. You need to set the API keys in the SecretConstants.cs file and update the "option.env" value in default.aspx file!
2. This sample uses the RestSharp library. You can add it to your project using NuGet in Visual Studio.
